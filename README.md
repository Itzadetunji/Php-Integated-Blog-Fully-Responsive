Before running the php file.
Download xampp (here's a video to help with that) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOGcsq5TOGc .
Run Apach and Mysql.
Create a database with the name of "cms4.2.1" nothing more the name must be
exact and also make sure there is no password in your xampp or wampp if there is follow below:
If you have a password go to Includes/DB.php change the empty field '' to your password.
Import the database in "database(sql/" with the name "cms4.2.1"
When that is done login with username "itzadetunji" and password "1234".
